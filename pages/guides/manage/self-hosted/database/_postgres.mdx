## Postgres

:::caution
Postgres extension is currently in beta.
:::

If you want to use a PostgreSQL database instead of CockroachDB you can [overwrite the default configuration](../configure/configure.mdx).

Currently versions >= 14 are supported.

Postgres can be configured as follows:
```yaml
Database:
  postgres:
    Host: localhost
    Port: 5432
    Database: zitadel
    MaxOpenConns: 25
    MaxConnLifetime: 1h
    MaxConnIdleTime: 5m
    Options:
    User:
      Username: zitadel
      Password: zitadel
      SSL:
        Mode: disable
        RootCert:
        Cert:
        Key:
    Admin:
      Username: postgres
      Password: postgres
      SSL:
        Mode: disable
        RootCert:
        Cert:
        Key:
```
